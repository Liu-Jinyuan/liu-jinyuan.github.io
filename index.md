Jinyuan is currently a Ph.D. student in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of California San Diego. He works with [Sutanu Sarkar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mfQsfMwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in the [CFD Lab](http://www.cfdlab.ucsd.edu/index.html). His current research focus is turbulence and vortex dynamics in rotating, stratified environments.  

Jinyuan received his Bachelor's Degree in Engineering Themophysics from Tsinghua University, China, in 2020. After working as a post-baccalaureate researcher at the same institute for six months, he joined the CFD Lab in Jan. 2021.  He has also been working as a pre-doctoral researcher on turbulent boundary layers at the University of Waterloo and turbulent channels at Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.

Jinyuan is also an aviation photographer and a member of the [photography team](https://airways-photo.square.site/) of [Airways Magazine](https://airwaysmag.com/). [(Jetphotos gallery, ](https://www.jetphotos.com/photographer/144411) [Airways gallery)](https://airways-photo.square.site/jinyuan-liu) His shutter count exceeds 100,000. He swims and plays the trumpet, when he is not pretending to be a fluid dynamicist. He plays Go (Wei-Qi) since elementary school, and was ranked amateur 5-dan by the Chinese Go Association. 

His name in Chinese characters is 刘晋源.

### Miscellaneous  
<!-- (Things that I am convinced of but not supposed to believe)  
Knowledge is to be expanded by doing research, but is to be conversed by teaching and learning. If only normal work was performed, knowledge would not be expanded when transferred, but would even shrink a little bit.   
Professors have students that feed on their knowledge, and students have their students and so on to infinity.  
Difficulty is just another name of unfamiliarity.   -->
