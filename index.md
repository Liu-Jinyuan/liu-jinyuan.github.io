Jinyuan is currently a Ph. D. student in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at University of California San Diego. He works with [Prof. Sutanu Sarkar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mfQsfMwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in the [CFD Lab](http://www.cfdlab.ucsd.edu/index.html). His current research focus is turbulence and vortex dynamics in stratified environments.  

Jinyuan received his Batchelor's Degree in Engineering Themophysics from Tsinghua Univerisity, China, in 2020. After working as a post-baccalaureate researcher at the same institute for six months, he joined the CFD Lab in Jan. 2021.  He has also been working on turbulent boundary layers at the University of Waterloo and turbulent channels at Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.

Jinyuan is also an aviation photographer (shutter count ~70,000), with more than 380 photos published on the largest peer-reviewed database jetphotos.com [(personal profile)](https://www.jetphotos.com/photographer/144411). He swims and plays the trumpet. He played Go (Wei-Qi) previously, and was ranked amateur 5-dan by Chinese Go Association.
