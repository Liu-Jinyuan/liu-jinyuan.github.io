## Jinyuan J. Liu

Jinyuan is currently a Ph. D. Student in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at University of California San Diego. He works with [Prof. Sutanu Sarkar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mfQsfMwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in the [CFD Lab](http://www.cfdlab.ucsd.edu/index.html). His current research focus is turbulence and vortex dynamics in stratified environments.  

Jinyuan received his Batchelor's Degree in Engineering Themophysics from Tsinghua Univerisity, China, in 2020. After working as a post-baccalaureate researcher at the same institute for six months, he joined CFD Lab in Jan. 2021.  He has also been working on turbulent boundary layers at the University of Waterloo and turbulent channels at Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.
