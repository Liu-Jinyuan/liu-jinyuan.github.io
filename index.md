Jinyuan is currently a Ph.D. student in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of California San Diego. He works with [Sutanu Sarkar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mfQsfMwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in the [CFD Lab](http://www.cfdlab.ucsd.edu/index.html). His current research focus is turbulence and vortex dynamics in rotating, stratified wakes. He has a broad interest in wall-bounded and free-shear turbulence, as well as geophysical flows.   

Jinyuan received his Bachelor's Degree in engineering thermophysics from Tsinghua University, China, in 2020. After working as a post-baccalaureate researcher at the same institute for six months, he joined the CFD Lab in Jan. 2021. He had also been working as a pre-doctoral researcher on turbulent boundary layers at the University of Waterloo, and on turbulent channels at Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.

Jinyuan is also an aviation photographer and a member of the [photography team](https://airways-photo.square.site/) of [Airways Magazine](https://airwaysmag.com/). [(Jetphotos gallery, ](https://www.jetphotos.com/photographer/144411) [Airways gallery)](https://airways-photo.square.site/jinyuan-liu) His shutter count exceeds 100,000. He swims and plays the trumpet, when he is not pretending to be a fluid dynamicist. He has been playing Go (Wei-Qi) since elementary school, and was ranked amateur 5-dan by the Chinese Go Association. 

His name in Chinese characters is 刘晋源.
